### Introduction
This project is a study of DDPG algorithm. I follow the instruction provided by keras:
[Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)](https://keras.io/examples/rl/ddpg_pendulum/#introduction). 
The original paper this is based on is: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf)

This combines policy gradient and q learning for continuos action space reinforcement
learning problems.

I intend to create self defined environment, states and actions to extend the
usage of this algorithm to some financial problems.
